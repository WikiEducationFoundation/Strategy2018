              Wikipedia represents a powerful opportunity,
              perhaps only comparable to the creation of
              public libraries, for getting high quality
              knowledge out to the public.
              It combines the best
              standards for sourcing information with
              a system that allows for unprecedented
              reach. But we’re not there yet.
              Sometimes the knowledge you get
              from Wikipedia is great. But in many
              important topic areas, information can
              be unreliable, misleading, or missing.

                Wikipedia’s volunteer base means its
representation of knowledge is skewed.
For example, only 17% of Wikipedia’s
biographies are of women. This skew is
a problem in traditional publishing too,
and academia is beginning to embrace
knowledge equity in their own work.

                Wikipedia has become one of the
most trusted online sources of
information.
              </p>
              <p>
                When people search for information,
                Wikipedia provides them with
                the facts they need in order to make
                their own best life choices.
              </p>
              <p class="orange-text">
                Simultaneously, the way people
interact with information and seek
answers is transforming.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whereas people used to find answers by
running a Google search and reading
Wikipedia, they’re now increasingly
using intelligent personal assistants like
Alexa or Siri.

                The Implications for Wiki Education
              </h3>
              <p>
                Wikipedia remains an important source
of information for millions and millions
of people. Wiki Education’s work will
ensure Wikipedia’s depth and breadth
of content is more complete, especially
for highly viewed topics that are
currently underdeveloped.
              </p>
              <p>
                But with digital assistants and other
devices relying increasingly on
structured data (instead of relying
solely on Wikipedia), we will expand
our efforts to Wikidata.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will provide people with more
complete and reliable information,
wherever and however they choose to
access that information.
              </p>
              <p>
                We call this strategic priority “Reach”.
